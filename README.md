# assetChain

This is a blockchain implementation that allows using the blockchain as an open database.

## Miners 
Miners make entries into the database. To maintain data secrecy, an encrypted version of each message is sent to the blockchain.


## Requesters

Data can be accesssed by making http requests to see the whole blockchain, or specific blocks.
